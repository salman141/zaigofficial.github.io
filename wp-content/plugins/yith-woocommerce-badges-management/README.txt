YITH WooCommerce Badge Management allows you to create and manage custom badges for products.


== Description == 

Make your website more attractive with badges inviting customers to buy. It is not just a matter of appearance, it has been proved to increase sales up to 55%. Badges are an interesting tool, because they act on users' mind as spotlights that draw their attention upon a specific product, a specific offer, or attract them and make their interest higher and their will to purchase increases. Try YIThemes badges, highly customisable, in colour, text and position. Yet, a suggestion: do not exaggerate! A different badge for each product is like putting none upon them.

= Features: =

* A specific panel to create unlimited textual badges. Options allow to set badge colour, text, text colour and badge position.
* 5 image badges included in the plugin, with a graphic by YITH.
* A select menu for each product to choose the type of badge to set.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the downloaded zip file.
2. Upload the plugin folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
3. Activate `YITH WooCommerce Badge Management` from Plugins page

YITH WooCommerce Badge Management will add:

* a new submenu called "Badge Management" under "YITH" menu, where you are able to configure all the plugin settings.
* a new menu called "Badges" in WordPress admin menu, where you are able to manage your badges.
